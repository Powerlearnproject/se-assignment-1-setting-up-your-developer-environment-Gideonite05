SOmetimes I did face a tough time using the git bash shell to get some commands executed. 
It keep showing me error and even with attempts many times.
But like I was told in lecture time to reach out for help through a fellow humans like me (the chat page provided that opportunity) and aslo i did consult AI technology (like chat GPT for solution). And I was able to scale through the challenges. thanks to the PLP Instructor for enough guide.
